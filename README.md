# FNS-simulation_examples

Note that, in order to run some of the examples the user should have to increase the 'heap size' in JAVA . Please refer to the user manual for the instructions.


Through the folder 'single_node' the user will be able to reproduce the activity within a single node.
In order to obtain the .CSVs of the model activity (firing.CSV and burning.CSV) in the folder FNS/single_node/output, the following "experiment command" can be used:

> .\start.bat single_node -M  (Windows)

or 

$ ./start single_node -M  (Linux)

Through the folder 'resonance_pair' the user will be able to reproduce the Resonance Pair mechanism, as described in the paper of:
- Maslennikov and Nekorkin, 2014. Modular networks with delayed coupling: Synchronization and frequency control. Phys. Rev. E 90.
- Gollo, L. et al., 2014. Mechanisms of zero-lag synchronization in cortical motifs. PLOS computational biology 10 (4), 1â€“17)
In order to obtain the .CSVs of the model activity (firing.CSV and burning.CSV) in the folder FNS/resonance_pair/output, you can use the following "experiment command" can be used:

> .\start.bat resonance_pair -M  (Windows)

or 

$ ./start resonance_pair -M  (Linux)

Through the folder 'dynamical_relaying' the user will be able to reproduce the Dynamical Relaying mechanism, as described in the paper of Vicente et al., 2008: "Dynamical relaying can yield zero time lag neuronal synchrony despite long conduction delays".
In order to obtain the .CSVs of the model activity (firing.CSV and burning.CSV) in the folder FNS/dynamical_relaying/output, you can use the following "experiment command" can be used:

> .\start.bat dynamical_relaying -M  (Windows)

or 

$ ./start dynamical_relaying -M  (Linux)

Through the folder 'connectivity_14' the user will be able to simulate the Default Mode Network (composed of 14 regions) of a real subject, described in the paper "FNS: an event-driven spiking neural network based on the LIFL model" (in review).
In order to obtain the .CSVs of the model activity (firing.CSV and burning.CSV) in the folder FNS/connectivity_14/output, the following "experiment command" can be used:

> .\start.bat connectivity_14 -M  (Windows)

or 

$ ./start connectivity_14 -M  (Linux)
